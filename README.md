# Barometer Example

Page 1: Barometer Example Documentation

## Introduction

The Barometer Example is a Flutter application that utilizes the Flutter Barometer plugin to measure and analyze pressure data. This application allows users to measure surface pressure, bottom pressure, compare pressures, calculate building height, and show outliers in the pressure data. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the barometer functionality.

## Dependencies

The Barometer Example requires the following dependencies:

- `flutter_barometer`: A Flutter plugin for accessing the barometer sensor on the device.

## Usage

To use the Barometer Example in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Add the `flutter_barometer` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_barometer: ^[version]
   ```
2. Import the required packages in your Dart file:
   ```dart
   import 'dart:math';
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'dart:async';
   import 'package:flutter_barometer/flutter_barometer.dart';
   ```
3. Create a `Screen` widget and implement the necessary logic and UI components for measuring and analyzing pressure data.

## Widget Structure

The Barometer Example consists of the following widgets:

- `Screen` (StatefulWidget)
  - `_ScreenState` (State)
    - `pressureData` (List<double>): Holds the collected pressure data.
    - `bottomPressure` (double): Stores the bottom pressure value.
    - `surfacePressure` (double): Stores the surface pressure value.
    - `MeasureSurfacePressure` (Future<void>): Measures the surface pressure using the barometer sensor.
    - `MeasureBottomPressure` (Future<void>): Measures the bottom pressure using the barometer sensor.
    - `build` (Widget): Builds the UI of the application.
    - `calculateHeight` (void): Calculates the building height based on pressure data.
    - `ShowOutliers` (void): Displays the outliers in the pressure data.
    - `_comparePress` (void): Compares the bottom pressure with a predefined value.

## Functionality

The Barometer Example provides the following functionality:

1. Measure Surface Pressure: This feature allows users to measure the surface pressure by clicking the "Measure Surface Pressure" button.

2. Measure Bottom Pressure: Users can measure the bottom pressure by clicking the "Measure Bottom Pressure" button.

3. Calculate Building Height: Users can calculate the building height based on the collected pressure data. The calculated height is displayed in an alert dialog.

4. Compare Bottom Pressure: Users can compare the bottom pressure with a predefined value and receive a message indicating whether the FCAI building has lower pressure, higher pressure, or the same pressure.

5. Show Outliers: Users can display the outliers in the pressure data. The number of pressure data points before and after removing outliers, along with the lists, are shown in an alert dialog.

## Notes

- The application assumes a constant threshold value of 1013.25 for identifying outliers. You can adjust this threshold as needed based on your requirements.
- The application uses the Flutter Barometer plugin to access the barometer sensor on the device. Make sure to grant necessary permissions to access the sensor.

Page 2: Code Explanation

The code provided is the implementation of the Barometer Example. It consists of the following components:

- `Screen` Widget: This widget represents the main screen of the application. It contains the UI layout and defines the interaction logic.

- `_ScreenState` State: This state class manages the state of the `Screen` widget. It stores the pressure data, bottom pressure, and surface pressure. It also includes methods for measuring pressures, calculating building height, showing outliers, and comparing pressures.

- `MeasureSurfacePressure` and `MeasureBottom

Pressure`methods: These methods use the`flutterBarometerEvents`stream provided by the Flutter Barometer plugin to listen for barometer events and update the respective pressure values. The measured pressure values are stored in the`pressureData` list.

- `calculateHeight` method: This method calculates the building height based on the pressure data. It uses the formula `(T + 37) / L * log(P / pressure)` to calculate the height, where `T` represents the absolute temperature, `L` is the temperature lapse rate, and `P` is the pressure at sea level.

- `ShowOutliers` method: This method identifies and displays the outliers in the pressure data. It calculates the mean and standard deviation of the pressure data and removes data points that deviate more than a predefined threshold from the mean. The `pressureDataBeforeRemoveOutliers` and `pressureDataAfterRemoveOutliers` lists are used to display the data before and after removing outliers.

- `_comparePress` method: This method compares the bottom pressure with a predefined value (`fciPress`). It displays a message indicating whether the FCAI building has lower pressure, higher pressure, or the same pressure.

- UI Components: The code includes various UI components such as buttons, text widgets, and an app bar. These components are organized using the `Column` and `Row` widgets to create the desired layout.

Please note that the provided code may require additional configurations and dependencies to run properly in a Flutter project. Make sure to check the Flutter Barometer plugin documentation for more details on its usage and compatibility.
